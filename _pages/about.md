I am a second-year graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), advised by [Polina Golland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/). My primary research interest is in analyzing medical imaging data using computer vision and machine learning, to provide insights into diseases and improve the quality of clinical care.

I previously worked in the [Yale Radiology Research Lab](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/radresearch/), building interpretable neural networks for liver cancer diagnosis. I received a Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering at Yale, where I worked on computational models of heart muscle contraction under [Stuart Campbell](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/stuart-campbell).
