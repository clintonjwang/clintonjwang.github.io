I am a second-year graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology supervised by Polina Golland. My primary research interest is in analyzing medical imaging data using deep learning to provide insights into diseases and improve the quality of clinical care. I currently collaborate with physicians at Massachusetts General Hospital to characterize brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of stroke patients, seeking to reveal image patterns that predict patient outcomes. I previously worked in the Yale Radiology Research Lab, building interpretable neural network models for liver cancer diagnosis. I received a Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering at Yale, where I developed a computational model of heart muscle contraction that helps explain the link between MYBPC3 mutations and cardiac hypertrophy.
